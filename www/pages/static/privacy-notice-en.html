<h3>What we mean by personal information</h3>
<p>Personal information is defined in section 3 of the Privacy Act as “information about an identifiable individual that is recorded in any form”. It includes information related to age, ethnic origin, religion, marital status, home and email addresses, user names etc. All personal information that we obtain from you in relation to GCcollab will be dealt with in accordance with the provisions of the Privacy Policy and the Access to Information Privacy Policy.</p>

<h2>How GCcollab protects your privacy</h2>
<h3>Collection</h3>
<ul>
    <li>All personal information within GCcollab is considered to be voluntarily provided and any use or disclosure will be governed by the rights of access to, correction of and protection of personal information under the Privacy Act.</li>
    <li>GCcollab users are advised that all information / content posted to a federal government collaborative site is subject to the provisions of the Access to Information Act and the Privacy Act. This implies that information may be accessed and disclosed in response to a request under either of these Acts.</li>
    <li>For maximum privacy protection, it is recommended that users do not post personal information such as photographs, home addresses, resumes, etc., as this information would then be available to all users. Note however that the Privacy Act does not require any protection for certain types of personal information such as is relevant to the positions and functions of public servants therefore, this type of personal information can be posted and is in fact encouraged. This includes such things as an employee's departmental subject matter area of expertise, his or her work coordinates (including email address and government-issued telephone and cell phone number), his/her title and classification and views and/or opinions he/she would normally express in the course of fulfilling his/her duties.</li>
    <li>When a contribution is made, the user needs to be logged-in and GCcollab (Elgg) stores the contribution information which includes user name, and the date and time of the action.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Disclosure</h3>
<p>Your personal information is not shared, sold, rented, traded, or otherwise disclosed to any outside third party except with your consent or where authorized and or required by law.</p>

    <li>IP networking address information, and its connection to any usernames that share it, may be released only under certain circumstances.</li>
    <li>We do not expose IP address of Logged-in contributors to the public except in cases of abuse, including vandalism of the service. A user's IP address may be stored on the web servers for a period of time, during which it can be seen by network administrators who have network administration access.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Cookies</h3>
<ul>
    <li>The GCcollab platform may use cookies to improve your navigation experience or to allow you to choose to stay logged on across multiple sessions. Although GCcollab does not use cookies to track how visitors use this site or to determine sites previously visited, the web server log may store traffic information for debugging purposes. If you have your cookies notification option activated on your browser, the system will notify you before any cookies are used so that you may refuse them.</li>
    <li>The site will set a session cookie (temporary until browser closed) on a user's browser whenever a page is visited. If a user / contributor saves a username or password in his / her browser, that information will be saved in a persistent cookie for up to 30 days, and this information will be resent to the server on every visit.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Browsing and reading pages</h3>
<p>When a visitor browses or reads a page, minimal information is collected; similar to what is typically collected by web sites. The GCcollab service provider may keep raw logs of such transactions, but these will not be published or used to track legitimate users.</p>
<p>The GCcollab platform collects no more information with respect to which pages users read than is typically collected in server logs by web sites. Aside from the above-mentioned raw log data collected for general purposes, page visits do not expose a visitor's identity publicly. Sampled raw log data may include the IP address of any user, but it is not reproduced publicly.</p>

<h3>User contributions</h3>
<p>Contributions are identified with the username of the contributor. Such information will be available permanently.</p>
<p><strong>User contributions are aggregated and available to system administrators. User contributions are aggregated according to the user’s registration and login status.</strong></p>
