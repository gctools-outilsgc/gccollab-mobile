    <p>GCcollab is your professional collaboration platform, connecting you to information and people from across the Government of Canada. GCcollab is open to students and academics from all Canadian universities and colleges as well as federal, provincial and territorial public servants. GCcollab is a major step toward a more innovative, open, and collaborative way of identifying, exploring and co-creating the policy and research agendas.</p>

    <p>GCcollab is expected to increase the depth and breadth of data and information sharing between the academic and public sector communities to support improved deliberation on policy issues. GCcollab is also expected to build a more connected, relevant and responsive cohort of public servants, students and academics.</p>

    <p>GCcollab is predicted to also contribute to a culture change as the existing public service is provided better access to emerging research, technologies, and communication approaches, and conversely, as academics and students improve their understanding of the policy, program and research development processes.</p>

    <p>This cloud-based collaboration platform will also be leveraged to promote recruitment opportunities to those interested in joining the federal public service. To learn, connect and share, join <a href="https://gccollab.ca/register" class="external">GCcollab</a>.</p>
