<h3>Technical</h3>

<p><strong>Which software does GCcollab run on?</strong></p>
<p>GCcollab uses <a href="https://elgg.org/" class="external">Elgg</a>, open source social networking software that provides individuals and organizations with the components needed to create an online social environment.</p>

<p><strong>Can GCcollab be used by Crown corporations?</strong></p>
<p>Although it is true that GCcollab is readily available to departments with a “gc.ca” and "canada.ca" email, other organizations can still use GCcollab by accessing SCNet (SecureChannel). The “gc.ca” rule is not entirely accurate; there are many organizations, such as Crown corporations, that do not have emails that end in “gc.ca” but that are still connected to SCNet. The cost of accessing SCNet is not technically or financially out of reach for most organizations.</p>

<p><strong>I have a file bigger than 32MB and would like to upload it to GCcollab?</strong></p>
<p>The system only allows files smaller than 32MB to be uploaded, so it's best to compress your file to 32MB then upload to GCcollab.</p>
